# Day 14

This one was pretty annoying. The base algorithm for part B wasn't terrible to implement, but I got stuck on an
off-by-one error for a good while, not helped by the fact that I'm coming down with the flu and my head's entirely
there. Anyway, I was pretty lost for a bit but eventually worked out that there was probably a recurring pattern, and I
was pretty relieved when it turned out that there was.
