# Day 04

I have no idea what's going on with the difficulty anymore; today's problem was dead simple. Part B required a _bit_
more thought, but the solution is still pretty obvious once you work out the pattern and the problem text even sort of
guides you in the right direction.

I was expecting part B to be something like "Actually, you get double points for the right numbers in the right place"
when I first read part A, but the actual problem was a lot more interesting (if a bit contrived).

Today's dumb mistake was (naturally) an off-by-one error where I was cleaving the string which led to about 5 minutes
of confusion as to why it was ignoring the first number entirely.
