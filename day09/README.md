# Day 09

Today's problem was a little annoying. I wanted to try to avoid storing the whole list of sets, but it ended up being
easier to just do that. I think I probably could have just stored the first and last values, but the code is messy
enough as it is.

Part B was super simple and only required adding one new line of logic to each primary loop. It's literally just the
same computation, only at the beginning of the list and in reverse.
