# Day 02

Today's problem was a lot easier, although because I'm still pretty, well, rusty with Rust iterators it ended up taking
me some time anyway. As always, the code is pretty messy and contains exactly zero error-checking, but hey, that's what
AoC is all about.

Part B was super easy to implement because it literally just required tracking the maximum value per color per game and
then adding some math to calculate the part B answer. I was expecting it to be something like the balls are actually
removed from the bag each game and what's the minimum number of each color necessary for this, but the actual problem
was just as straightforward or maybe even moreso.
