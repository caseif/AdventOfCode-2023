# Day 16

Today's problem was merciful. The problem is super simple and the algorithm is really obvious, so it wasn't difficult at
all to get a solution working straight away for part A (apart from the usual off-by-one error). Part B was also
basically just generalizing the algorithm of the first part. I think I was probably supposed to use memoization to speed
up the computation, but it would have been annoying to deal with multiple beams intersecting a tile and in any case my
naive solution takes less than 3 seconds to complete on my laptop, so it's good enough.
