# Day 03

Today's problem was huge pain to parse for both parts, and it turned out my approach for part A (scan the whole file
twice) didn't fit part B at all, so the two solutions share almost no code. Apart from this, I mainly just spent a lot
of time trying to work out the standard library functions for collections and iterators again and also trying to figure
out in which contexts it's actually legal to use the index operator.
