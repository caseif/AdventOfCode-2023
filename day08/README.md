# Day 08

Pretty easy problem today, although it turns out the correct solution to part B was _not_ in fact to use a `u128` to
store the product of all 6 path lengths. I was kind of hoping they would all end up being prime, but no such luck. I did
cheat a bit and use WolframAlpha to compute the LCM - I'll probably add some code to solve for this after the weekend.

I initially tried to brute force part B, but it ran and ran with no end in sight so I figured it wasn't feasible. Seeing
as the final answer was 17 trillion-something, this was a good call.

**Update:** LCM code has been added :)
